This library contains:

- A set of parsers that parse the output of the Maven command "mvn dependency:tree"; 
  different parsers can be used to parse the following output formats: text, dot, graphml and tgf. 
  See http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/tree-mojo.html for further details.
  The following idiom is the recommended way to parse any input:
  
  InputType type = ...;
  Reader r = ...;
  Parser parser = type.newParser();
  Node tree = parser.parse(r);
  
  Note that this library is NOT a drop-in replacement for the Maven Mercury 
  DependencyTreeBuilder API (see http://maven.apache.org/mercury/). 
  In other words, it does NOT make any dependency resolution whatsoever per itself;
  it simply takes an already-built dependency tree and parses it to an object representation
  that is lightweight and easily reusable.

- A set of visitors that can be used to scan the parsed tree. In particular, visitors can be 
  used to create human-readable representations of the parsed tree. E.g. the following code
  transforms the parsed tree back again to the Maven standard text format:

  Node tree = ...; 
  StandardTextVisitor visitor = new StandardTextVisitor();
  visitor.visit(tree);
  System.out.println(visitor);
        
- A set of Velocity renderers that create HTML representations of the parsed tree. These renderers rely upon JQuery (see http://jquery.com) and some JQuery plugins: 
  - JSTree: see http://www.jstree.com/
  - TreeTable: see http://plugins.jquery.com/project/treeTable
  These utilities are inteded as examples of HTML code; feel free to adapt them to your needs.
  To generate the HTML code and all the secondary resources (images, CSS files, etc.), run the class
  fr.dutra.tools.maven.deptree.extras.VelocityRendererMain with the following arguments:
  - Full path of dependency tree file to parse;
  - Dependency tree file format; one of: TEXT, DOT, GRAPHML or TGF;
  - Full path to the output directory where HTML files and static resources will be generated (this directory will be erased prior to file generation);
  - Renderer format; one of: 
    - JQUERY_JSTREE (uses JQuery plugin JSTree)
    - JQUERY_TREE_TABLE (uses JQuery plugin TreeTable)
